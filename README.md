## Architecture

The app follows a **multi-module architecture**, allowing each feature to function independently while maintaining a shared codebase for common functionality. The app is structured as follows:

- **Matchmaking & Dating Module**
- **Buy/Sell/Rent Module**
- **Job Search Module**
- **Matrimony Module**
- **Core Module** (Shared components like network, database, utilities)

This modular architecture enhances maintainability, scalability, and testing. Each module can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, reducing the complexity of the overall system.
